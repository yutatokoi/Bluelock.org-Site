        <h1>Thesis</h1><b></b>
        <p>With a more dormant lifestyle being accelerated by staying home, the need for exercising has increased. The website aims to guide users through exercises that they can do depending on the fitness level they are at. </p><b></b>
        <p>Heart rate levels 
            Our training website is unique in the way that we make you the user push yourself harder. Generally the human body tells you how hard you’re working through the heart rate. (the heart rate never lies!!) 
            Calculating max heart rate!!
            220 - your age = max heart rate
            Example: 
            220 - 17 = 203 
            
            With that I want you to divide it by 6. Therefore, we know our max heart rate within 10 seconds. 
            Max heart rate / 6 = Beats per 10 seconds 
            Example: 
            203 / 6 = 33 
            Heart rate ranges
            We will be dividing our workouts within a number of ranges. Effort level pink, Effort level blue, and Effort level red.
            Heart rate ranges calculations 
            Effort level pink 
            Max heart rate within 10 seconds - 15 or 18 = pink level ( little bit above resting heart rate) 
            Example: 
            33 - 15 or 18 = 18 or 15
            
            Effort level blue
            Max heart rate within 10 seconds - 10 or 12 = blue level ( faster pace workouts that get someone to sweat) 
            Example: 
            33 - 10 or 12 = 23 or 21 
            
            Effort level red 
            Max heart rate within 10 seconds - 4 or 5 = red level ( all effort maxing out the body) 
            Example:
            33 - 4 or 5 = 29 or 28 
            
            Using the heart rate ranges we are going to be able to divide each workout into heart rate groups. ie) the beginning of the workout would be at a lower heart rate but as the workout progresses the heart rate level rises hence more effort would be needed. 
            
            Generally, we don’t want participants to reach their max heart rate but a heart rate where they would be comfortable doing exercises. For me, that would be at a heart rate of around 29~30 which would be enough for me to be sweating and working my body but not pushing it to the full extent.
